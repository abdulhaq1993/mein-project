      <h1>Every idea starts with a need</h1>
      
       <p>Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I
           could improve my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted 
           to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper 
           and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge,
            something that makes more sense with what I thought. I saw that many 
            designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user interface, I really
             liked the idea, but the problem was that the result was just something
              nice and did not solve any problem.

      <h3>Start with asking </h3>
         <p>why You will start seeing things differently and coming <br> up 
                with more effective ways of achieving goals.</p>
        <h3>Your ideas will have more value</h3>
                <p>By looking at problems from a different <br> perspective, your ideas will be fresher and more valuable.</p>

                 <h3>Design solutions with love </h3>
                 <p>Only when you experience a problem yourself do <br> you understand the frustration of the users and resolve to end it.
                </p>
                 <h3>Share and show your work</h3>
                 <p>s designers, we are often afraid of showing work <br> that’s not finished or doesn’t look perfect. You will <br> learn to accept feedback and learn from it.
